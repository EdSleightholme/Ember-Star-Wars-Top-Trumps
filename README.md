# ember Star Wars Top Trumps
This app is my first attempt at a ember app. Is was built over 8 hours over a weekend.
It allows you to select a value from your randomly generated card and play against a opponents randomly generated card.
Cards are generated from the api https://swapi.dev

This project is still missing tests and has numerous bugs. But the main bulk of styling and content layout and structure are done.
